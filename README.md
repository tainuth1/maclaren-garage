## Model Details

### McLaren Car

- **Scale**: 0.7x (optimized for garage fit)
- **Position**: Centered in garage
- **Materials**: Enhanced with environment mapping and glass properties
- **Glass Effects**: Windshield with transmission, IOR, and dark tinting

### Garage Environment

- **Lighting**: Ambient + multiple point lights (configurable)
- **Materials**: All surfaces enhanced with reflection mapping
- **Optimization**: Hidden unnecessary geometry for performance

## Controls

- **Mouse Drag**: Rotate camera around the scene
- **Mouse Wheel**: Zoom in/out (constrained between 3.5-4.5 units)
- **Constrained Movement**: Limited azimuth and polar angles for optimal viewing

## Development

The project uses modern ES modules and Vite for fast development with hot module replacement. All 3D assets are optimized GLTF models with proper material definitions.

Perfect for showcasing McLaren vehicles in an immersive 3D environment!
